🍽️ Restaurant Order Analysis with SQL.
This project explores restaurant menu data and order transactions using SQL to derive actionable business insights.
It focuses on understanding menu item performance, customer order behavior, and revenue generation patterns.


📁 Dataset Overview
The analysis uses two main tables:
menu_items: Contains item details including name, category, and price.
order_details: Records of each order placed, including order time and item ID.

🛠️ Project Setup
Run create_restaurant_db.sql to create the schema and populate the tables.
Use db_1.sql and db_2.sql for basic data exploration.
Run restaurant_order_analysis.sql for deeper analysis.
